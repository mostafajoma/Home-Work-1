### Ripple Labs

Ripple Labs is a private computer software company based in San Francisco, California. U.S. It was founded by Chris Larsen, a business executive and angel investor of many Silicon Valley technologies. And by Jeb McCaleb, an American entrepreneur and programmer. Ripple Labs offers two completely different entities
(1)  cryptocurrency (XRP) that can be traded. 
(2) a transaction protocol (RTXP) for RTGS (Real-time gross settlement). 

1-	XPR- The Cryptocurrency:
XPR is blockchain based Cryptocurrency. It was first released in 2012 and improved upon Bitcoin by moving away from mining, which is energy inefficient. XPR journal achieves its objective through a method called consensus. Which is for everyone on the network to agree on the current state of the blockchain. XPR had the biggest price movement in 2017 which peaked to $3.38. This positive rally led Ripple Labs to a strategic partnership with credit card companies throughout Asia. 
2-	(RTXP) Ripple’s Transaction Protocol:
is a real-time gross settlement system built based on open source internet protocol. Today’s payment infrastructure moves money from one payment system to another through sequence of internal transfer across financial institutions. Which leads to be slow and costly. For instance, a U.S. bank is sending a payment to a Brazilian bank. The U.S. bank makes an RTGS (Real-time gross settlement).  transfer to a local correspondent bank. The U.S. correspondent bank holds a nostro account with a Brazilian correspondent, and provides foreign exchange for the transaction. The Brazilian correspondent debits the U.S. correspondent bank’s nostro account and pays the receiving bank to completed the transfer. The process may take up days and up to weeks in some cases. Where RTXP would significantly reduces costs associated with treasury and operation (by using XPR the Cryptocurrency) RTXP enables real-time value exchange and transfer to anywhere in the world providing liquidity on demand entirely frictionless with fewer barriers to complete the transaction than correspondent banking system. The inter ledger Protocol allows banks and non-bank financial services companies to incorporate the protocol into their own system, and allow their clients to use the service. Ripple’s Lab has partnered with banks and other financial services clients to test the RTXP technology which includes, American express, Santander Bank, MoneyGram, PNC Bank, Ria, Interbank, and many more. By adopting the RTXP Protocol the banks will:
•	The bank will hold its domestic currency and one account with XPR
•	By making markets directly between its domestic currency and XRP, the bank minimizes the number of intermediaries involved and their markup on spreads.
•	The bank only needs enough XRP on hand to service its largest expected payment obligation
•	XRP can help banks eliminate or lower Foreign Exchange, Currency Hedging, Treasury Operations, Liquidity, Payment Operations and Basel (LCR).



The system was founded in May of 2011 and released in 2012. The major source of funding the company has been the sales of its cryptocurrency (XPR). It has sold approximately one million and two hundred thousand US dollar between the year 2016 and 2019. Ripple Lab is also privately funded company including IDG Capital $94 million U.S dollars, SBI Investment $55 million U.S dollars, Santander InnoVentures $4 million U.S dollar and others. According to the latest evaluation the company was evaluated to be worth $10 billion U.S dollars. 

  Ripple's Lab is aiming to replace and take a market share from SWIFT, a nerwork that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transaction in a stadardized and reliable enviroment. the worlds' bank use SWIFT to transfer an approximate of 6 trillion U.S dollars a day. for the last 10 years Ripple has grown significantly and has become one of the top five among its competitors.and ranked to be the third most traded with over $1 billion 24-hour volume and $8 billion market cap.
    
Ripple vs Competitors by revenue: (in U.S.D)
Ripple			$652M
Bitcoin.com		$5M
Dogecoin		$3M
Litecoin			$7.6M
Coinbase			$569.8M
Ethereum		$4M
Even though Ripple has been growing but it is unlikely to be beneficial to large value payments. This is due to the system of RTXP relying on large banks to be connectors for the high value payments, as the large banks have the liquidity. Nevertheless, it is very beneficial to with smaller transaction sizes, as it reduces the settlements times in the current system.
